Malware of different families may not like each other. For example, different malware binaries might try to uninstall each other before infecting a system. This is an interesting case of 'environment-sensitive malware'. There are some anecdotal evidences (blogs). To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior research addressing this problem in a systematic way. In this research we systematically try explore the scene in the wild. We ran multiple malware samples from different families at the same time in the Anubis environment (a dynamic full-system-emulation-based malware analysis environment). We later analyzed the results of the emulation and detect such behaviors.
We used clustering algorithm to cluster the malware based on its resources activities such as file,registry,section,syncs. With this apporach we could find 30 paris of malware that were indeed battling each other. :)
