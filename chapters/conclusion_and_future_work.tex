We presented a systematic approach to find the behavioral interference between the malware families at large scale.
We analyzed the behavioral profile of millions of malware samples and found interfering pairs.
We used document clustering to cluster the malware samples into different families and heuristics to select probable candidate pairs.

We found {\gettotalcandidatepairs{}} probable candidate pairs exhibiting behavioral interference with the true positive rate of {\gettruepositiverate{}}.


To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to do the research on the topic.
We showed that the behavioral interference exists and also illustrated an approach to find such case where malware try to detect the presence of file created by another malware and delete it.
% This case is 

Our research provides a novel insights on they dynamic behavior of malware.
